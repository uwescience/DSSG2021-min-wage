# DSSG2021-min-wage

Repo for code that can run outside the enclave, such as distance calculations, manipulation of shapefiles, aggregated maps, etc.

### Contribution Workflow:
We recommend using a `feature branch` workflow: each user works on their own **local** `feature branch`, pushes final changes to a **remote** `feature brnach`. From the remote branch they can submit a **pull request** to the main branch on GitHub.
